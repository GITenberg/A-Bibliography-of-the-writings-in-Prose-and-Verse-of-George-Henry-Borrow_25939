ix</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The object of the present Bibliography is to give a concise
account, accompanied by accurate collations, of the original
editions of the Books and Pamphlets of George Borrow, together
with a list of his many contributions to Magazines and other
Publications.&nbsp; It will doubtless be observed that no
inconsiderable portion of the Bibliography deals with the
attractive series of Pamphlets containing Ballads, Poems, and
other works by Borrow which were printed for Private Circulation
during the course of last year.&nbsp; Some account of the origin
of these pamphlets, and some information regarding the material
of which they are composed, may not be considered as inopportune
or inappropriate.</p>
<p>As a writer of English Prose Borrow long since achieved the
position which was his due; as a writer of English Verse he has
yet to come by his own.</p>
<p>The neglect from which Borrow&rsquo;s poetical compositions
(by far the larger proportion of which are translations from the
Danish and other tongues) have suffered has arisen from one
cause, and from one cause alone,&mdash;the fact that up to the
present moment only his earliest and, in the majority of cases,
his least successful efforts have been available to students of
his work.</p>
<p><!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>In 1826, when Borrow passed his <i>Romantic Ballads</i>
through the Press, he had already acquired a working knowledge of
numerous languages and dialects, but of his native tongue he had
still to become a master.&nbsp; In 1826 his appreciation of the
requirements of English Prosody was of a vague description, his
sense of the rhythm of verse was crude, and the attention he paid
to the exigencies of rhyme was inadequate.&nbsp; Hence the
majority of his Ballads, beyond the fact that they were faithful
reproductions of the originals from which they had been
laboriously translated, were of no particular value.</p>
<p>But to Borrow himself they were objects of a regard which
amounted to affection, and there can be no question that
throughout a considerable portion of his adventurous life he
looked to his Ballads to win for him whatever measure of literary
fame it might eventually be his fortune to gain.&nbsp; In
<i>Lavengro</i>, and other of his prose works, he repeatedly
referred to his &ldquo;bundle of Ballads&rdquo;; and I doubt
whether he ever really relinquished all hope of placing them
before the public until the last decade of his life had well
advanced.</p>
<p>That the Ballad Poetry of the old Northern Races should have
held a strong attraction for Borrow is not to be wondered
at.&nbsp; His restless nature and his roving habits were well in
tune with the spirit of the old Heroic Ballads; whilst his taste
for all that was mythical or vagabond (vagabond in the literal,
and not in the conventional, sense of the word) would prompt him
to welcome with no common eagerness the old Poems dealing with
matters supernatural and legendary.&nbsp; Has he not himself
recorded how, when fatigued upon a tiring march, he roused his
flagging spirits by shouting the refrain &ldquo;<i>Look out</i>,
<i>look out</i>, <i>Svend Vonved</i>!&rdquo;?</p>
<p><!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>In 1829, three years after the <i>Romantic Ballads</i>
had struggled into existence, Borrow made an effort to place them
before a larger public in a more complete and imposing
form.&nbsp; In collaboration with Dr. (afterwards Sir John)
Bowring he projected a work which should contain the best of his
old Ballads, together with many new ones, the whole to be
supported by the addition of others from the pen of Dr. Bowring.
<a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a>&nbsp; A Prospectus was drawn up and
issued in December, 1829, and at least two examples of this
Prospectus have survived.&nbsp; The brochure consists of two
octavo pages of letterpress, with the following
heading:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PROSPECTUS.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>It is proposed to publish</i>,
<i>in Two Volumes Octavo</i>,<br />
Price to Subscribers &pound;1 1<i>s.</i>, to Non-Subscribers
&pound;1 4<i>s.</i>,<br />
THE SONGS OF SCANDINAVIA,<br />
<span class="smcap">translated by</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Dr. BOWRING and Mr. BORROW</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">dedicated to

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>Then came a brief synopsis of the contents of the
volumes, followed by a short address on &ldquo;the debt of
justice due from England to Scandinavia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two additional pages were headed <i>List of Subscribers</i>,
and were left blank for the reception of names which, alas! were
recorded in no sufficient number.&nbsp; The scheme lapsed, Borrow
found his mission in other fields of labour, and not until 1854
did he again attempt to revive it.</p>
<p>But in 1854 Borrow made one more very serious effort to give
his Ballads life.&nbsp; In that year he again took them in hand,
subjected many of them to revision of the most drastic nature,
and proceeded to prepare them finally for press.&nbsp;
Advertisements which he drew up are still extant in his
handwriting, and reduced facsimiles of two of these may be seen
upon the opposite page.&nbsp; But again Fate was against him, and
neither <i>K&oelig;mpe Viser</i> nor <i>Songs of Europe</i> ever
saw the light. <a name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p0bb.jpg">
<img alt="Manuscript of the K&oelig;mpe Viser And Songs of Europe

</a></p>
<p>After the death of Borrow his manuscripts passed into the
possession of his step-daughter, Mrs. MacOubrey, from whom the
greater part were purchased by Mr. Webber, a bookseller of
Ipswich, who resold them to Dr. William Knapp.&nbsp; These
Manuscripts are now in the hands of the Hispanic Society, of New
York, and will doubtless remain for ever the property of the
American people.&nbsp; Fortunately, when disposing of the bulk of
her step-father&rsquo;s books and papers to Mr. Webber, Mrs.
MacOubrey retained the Manuscripts of the Ballads, together with
certain other <!-- page xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>documents of interest and
importance.&nbsp; It was from these Manuscripts that I was
afforded the opportunity of preparing the series of Pamphlets
printed last year.</p>
<p>The Manuscripts themselves are of four descriptions.&nbsp;
Firstly, the Manuscripts of certain of the new Ballads prepared
for the <i>Songs of Scandinavia</i> in 1829, untouched, and as
originally written; <a name="citation0c"></a><a
href="#footnote0c" class="citation">[0c]</a> secondly, other of
these new Ballads, heavily corrected by Borrow in a later
handwriting; thirdly, fresh transcripts, with the revised texts,
made in or about 1854, of Ballads written in 1829; and lastly
some of the more important Ballads originally published in 1826,
entirely re-written in 1854, and the text thoroughly revised.</p>
<p>As will be seen from the few examples I have given in the
following pages, or better still from a perusal of the pamphlets,
the value as literature of Borrow&rsquo;s Ballads as we now know
them is immeasurably higher than that hitherto placed upon them
by critics who had no material upon which to form their judgment
beyond the <i>Romantic Ballads</i>, <i>Targum</i>, and <i>The
Talisman</i>, together with the sets of minor verses included in
his other books.&nbsp; Borrow himself regarded his work in this
field as superior to that of Lockhart, and indeed seems to have
believed that one cause at least of his inability to obtain a
hearing was Lockhart&rsquo;s jealousy for his own <i>Spanish
Ballads</i>.&nbsp; Be that as it may&mdash;and Lockhart was
certainly sufficiently small-minded to render such a suspicion by
no means ridiculous <!-- page xvi--><a name="pagexvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>or absurd&mdash;I feel assured that
Borrow&rsquo;s metrical work will in future receive a far more
cordial welcome from his readers, and will meet with a fuller
appreciation from his critics, than that which until now it has
been its fortune to secure.</p>
<p>Despite the unctuous phrases which, in obedience to the
promptings of the Secretaries of the British and Foreign Bible
Society <a name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d"
class="citation">[0d]</a> whose interests he forwarded with so
much enterprise and vigor, he was at times constrained to
introduce into his official letters, Borrow was at heart a
Pagan.&nbsp; The memory of his father that he cherished most
warmly was that of the latter&rsquo;s fight, actual or mythical,
with &lsquo;Big Ben Brain,&rsquo; the bruiser; whilst the sword
his father had used in action was one of his best-regarded
possessions.&nbsp; To that sword he addressed the following
youthful stanzas, which until now have remained un-printed:</p>
<h3><!-- page xvii--><a name="pagexvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>THE SWORD</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Full twenty fights my father saw</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And died with twenty red wounds gored</i>;<br />
<i>I heir&rsquo;d what he so loved to draw</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>His ancient silver-handled sword</i>.</p>
<p><i>It is a sword of weight and length</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Of jags and blood-specks nobly full</i>;<br />
<i>Well wielded by his Cornish strength</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>It clove the Gaulman&rsquo;s helm and
scull</i>.</p>
<p><i>Hurrah</i>! <i>thou silver-handled blade</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Though thou&rsquo;st but little of the air</i><br
/>
<i>Of swords by Cornets worn on p&rsquo;rade</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To battle thee I vow to bear</i>.</p>
<p><i>Thou&rsquo;st decked old chiefs of Cornwall&rsquo;s
land</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To face the fiend with thee they dared</i>;<br />
<i>Thou prov&rsquo;dst a Tirfing in their hand</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Which victory gave whene&rsquo;er</i>
&rsquo;<i>twas bared</i>.</p>
<p><i>Though Cornwall&rsquo;s moors</i> &rsquo;<i>twas
ne&rsquo;er my lot</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To view</i>, <i>in Eastern Anglia born</i>,<br />
<i>Yet I her son&rsquo;s rude strength have got</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And feel of death their fearless scorn</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page xviii--><a name="pagexviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xviii</span><i>And when the foe we have in
ken</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And with my troop I seek the fray</i>,<br />
<i>Thou&rsquo;lt find the youth who wields thee then</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Will ne&rsquo;er the part of Horace play</i>.</p>
<p><i>Meanwhile above my bed&rsquo;s head hang</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>May no vile rust thy sides bestain</i>;<br />
<i>And soon</i>, <i>full soon</i>, <i>the war-trump&rsquo;s
clang</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Call me and thee to glory&rsquo;s plain</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These stanzas are interesting in a way which compels one to
welcome them, despite the poverty of the verse.&nbsp; The little
poem is a fragment of autobiographical <i>juvenilia</i>, and
moreover it is an original composition, and not a translation, as
is the greater part of Borrow&rsquo;s poetical work.</p>
<p>Up to the present date no Complete Collected Edition of
Borrow&rsquo;s Works has been published, either in this country
or in America.&nbsp; There is, however, good reason for hoping
that this omission will soon be remedied, for such an edition is
now in contemplation, to be produced under the agreeable
editorship of Mr. Clement Shorter.</p>
<p>It is, I presume, hardly necessary to note that every Book,
Pamphlet, and Magazine dealt with in the following pages has been
described <i>de visu</i>.</p>

houses were employed simultaneously in the production of this
work.</p>
<p>The preliminary matter of all six volumes was printed
together, and the reverse of each title-page carries at foot the
following imprint: &ldquo;<i>London</i>: / <i>Shackell and
Arrowsmith</i>, <i>Johnson&rsquo;s-Court</i>,
<i>Fleet-Street</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same firm also worked the whole of the Second Volume, and
their imprint is repeated at the foot of p. 574 [misnumbered

<p>Both Dr. Knapp and Mr. Clement Shorter have recorded full
particulars of the genesis of the <i>Celebrated Trials</i>.&nbsp;
Mr. Shorter devotes a considerable portion of Chapter xi of
<i>George Borrow and his Circle</i> to the subject, and furnishes
an analysis of the contents of each of the six volumes.&nbsp;
<i>Celebrated Trials</i> is, of course, the <i>Newgate Lives and
Trials</i> of <i>Lavengro</i>, in which book Borrow contrived to
make a considerable amount of entertaining narrative out of his
early struggles and failures.</p>

of: Half-title (with imprint &ldquo;<i>Printed by</i> / <i>J. and

251 is occupied by Advertisements of Horace Welby&rsquo;s
<i>Signs before Death</i>, and John Timbs&rsquo;s <i>Picturesque
Promenade round Dorking</i>.&nbsp; The headline is <i>Faustus</i>
throughout, upon both sides of the page.&nbsp; At the foot of the
reverse of p. 251 the imprint is repeated thus, &ldquo;<i>J. and
C. Adlard</i>, <i>Bartholomew Close</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
signatures are A (6 leaves), B to Q (15 sheets, each 8 leaves),
plus R (6 leaves).</p>
<p>Issued (in <i>April</i>, 1825) in bright claret-coloured linen
boards, with white paper back-label.&nbsp; The leaves measure
6&frac34; &times; 4&frac14; inches.&nbsp; The published price was
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
<p>The volume has as <i>Frontispiece</i> a coloured plate,
engraved upon copper, representing the supper of the sheep-headed
Magistrates, described on pp. 64&ndash;66.&nbsp; The incident
selected for illustration is the moment when the wine
&lsquo;issued in blue flames from the flasks,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;the whole assembly sat like so many ridiculous characters
in a mad masquerade.&rsquo;&nbsp; This illustration was not new
to Borrow&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; It had appeared both in the German
original, <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and in the French translation of
1798.&nbsp; In the original work the persons so bitterly
satirized were the individuals composing the Corporation of
Frankfort.</p>
<p>In 1840 &lsquo;remainder&rsquo; copies of the First Edition of
<i>Faustus</i> were issued with a new title-page, pasted upon a
stub, carrying at foot the following publishers&rsquo; imprint,
&ldquo;<i>London</i>: / <i>Simpkin</i>, <i>Marshall &amp; Co.</i>
/ 1840.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were made up in bright claret-coloured
linen boards, uniform with the original issue, with a white paper
back-label.&nbsp; The published price was again 7<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i></p>
<p><i>Faustus</i> was translated by Borrow from the German of
Friedrich Maximilian von Klinger.&nbsp; Mr. Shorter suggests,
with much reason, that Borrow did not make his translation from
the original German edition of 1791, but from a French
translation published in Amsterdam in 1798.</p>
<p>The reception accorded to <i>Faustus</i> was the reverse of
favourable.&nbsp; <i>The Literary Gazette</i> said (<i>July</i>
16<i>th</i>, 1825):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is another work to which no
respectable publisher ought to have allowed his name to be
put.&nbsp; The political allusion and metaphysics, which may have
made it popular among a low class in Germany, do not sufficiently
season its lewd scenes and coarse descriptions for British
palates.&nbsp; We have occasionally publications for the
fireside,&mdash;these are only fit for the fire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s translation of Klinger&rsquo;s novel was
reprinted in 1864, without any acknowledgment of the name of the
translator.&nbsp; Only a few stray words in the text were
altered.&nbsp; But five passages were deleted from the Preface,
which, not being otherwise modified or supplemented,
gave&mdash;as was no doubt the intention of the
publishers&mdash;the work the appearance of a new translation
specially prepared.&nbsp; This unhallowed edition bears the
following title-page:</p>
<p><i>Faustus</i>: / <i>His</i> / <i>Life</i>, <i>Death</i>,
<i>and Doom</i>. / <i>A Romance in Prose</i>. / <i>Translated
from the German</i>. / [Quotation as in the original edition,
followed by a Printer&rsquo;s ornament.] / <i>London</i>: / <i>W.
Kent and Co.</i>, <i>Paternoster Row</i>. / 1864.&mdash;Crown
8vo, pp. viii + 302.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;There is no reason to suppose,&rdquo; remarks Mr.
Shorter (<i>George Borrow and his Circle</i>, p. 104) &ldquo;that
the individual, whoever he may have been, who prepared the 1864
edition of <i>Faustus</i> for the Press, had ever seen either the
German original or the French translation of Klinger&rsquo;s
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a copy of the First Edition of <i>Faustus</i> in the
Library of the British Museum.&nbsp; The Press-mark is N.351.</p>

<p>The volume of <i>Romantic Ballads</i> was printed at Norwich
during the early months of 1826.&nbsp; The edition consisted of
Five Hundred Copies, but only Two Hundred of these were furnished
with the Title-page transcribed above.&nbsp; These were duly
distributed to the subscribers.&nbsp; The remaining Three Hundred
copies were forwarded to London, where they were supplied with
the two successive title-pages described below, and published in
the ordinary manner.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>I had an idea that</i>, <i>provided I
could persuade any spirited publisher to give these translations
to the world</i>, <i>I should acquire both considerable fame and
profit</i>;<i> not perhaps a world-embracing fame such as
Byron&rsquo;s</i>, <i>but a fame not to be sneered at</i>,
<i>which would last me a considerable time</i>, <i>and would keep
my heart from breaking</i>;&mdash;<i>profit</i>, <i>not equal to
that which Scott had made by his wondrous novels</i>, <i>but
which would prevent me from starving</i>, <i>and enable me to
achieve some other literary enterprise</i>.&nbsp; <i>I read and
re-read my ballads</i>, <i>and the more I read them the more I
was convinced that the public</i>, <i>in the event of their being
published</i>, <i>would freely purchase</i>, <i>and hail them
with merited applause</i>&rdquo;&mdash;[&ldquo;George Borrow and
his Circle,&rdquo; 1913, p. 102.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allan Cunningham&rsquo;s appreciation of the manner in which
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Borrow had succeeded in his effort to introduce the
Danish Ballads to English readers is well expressed in the
following letter:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">27, <i>Lower Belgrave
Place</i>,<br />
<i>London</i>.<br />
16<i>th</i> <i>May</i>, 1826.</p>
<p><i>My dear Sir</i>,</p>
<p><i>I like your Danish Ballads much</i>, <i>and though
Oehlensl&aelig;ger seems a capital poet</i>, <i>I love the old
rhymes best</i>.&nbsp; <i>There is more truth and simplicity in
them</i>;<i> and certainly we have nothing in our language to
compare with them</i>. . . . &lsquo;<i>Sir John</i>&rsquo; <i>is
a capital fellow</i>, <i>and reminds one of Burns&rsquo;</i>
&lsquo;<i>Findlay</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Sir
Middel</i>&rsquo; <i>is very natural and affecting</i>, <i>and
exceedingly well rendered</i>,&mdash;<i>so is</i> &lsquo;<i>The
Spectre of Hydebee</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>In this you have kept up
the true tone of the Northern Ballad</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Svend
Vonved</i>&rsquo; <i>is wild and poetical</i>, <i>and it is my
favourite</i>.&nbsp; <i>You must not think me insensible to the
merits of the incomparable</i>
&lsquo;<i>Skimming</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>I think I hear his
neigh</i>, <i>and see him crush the ribs of the Jute</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Get out of bed</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>George Borrow</i>,
<i>and be sick or sleepy no longer</i>.&nbsp; <i>A fellow who can
give us such exquisite Danish Ballads has no right to repose</i>.

Heddybee-Spectre</i>, and made an entirely new translation.&nbsp;
This was written in couplets, with a refrain repeated after
each.&nbsp; In 1854 the latter version was revised, and
represents the final text.&nbsp; It commences thus:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>At evening fall I chanced to ride</i>,<br />
<i>My courser to a tree I tied</i>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>So wide thereof the story goes</i>.</p>
<p><i>Against a stump my head I laid</i>,<br />
<i>And then to slumber I essay&rsquo;d</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>So wide thereof the story goes</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Manuscript of 1854 the ballad was printed (under the
amended title <i>The Heddeby Spectre</i>) in <i>Signelil</i>,
<i>A Tale from the Cornish</i>, <i>and Other Ballads</i>, 1913,
pp. 22&ndash;24.&nbsp; Borrow afterwards described the present
early version as &lsquo;a paraphrase.&rsquo;</p>

&ldquo;<i>I can</i>, <i>perhaps</i>,&rdquo; <i>said John</i>.</p>

Hill&rsquo;s side</i>, <i>and my eyes were beginning to
slumber</i>]</p>
<p>In the Manuscript of 1829 this Ballad is entitled <i>Elfin
Hill</i>, and the text differs considerably from that printed in
1826.&nbsp; I give the opening stanzas of each version.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1826.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I rested my head upon Elvir Hill&rsquo;s
side</i>, <i>and my eyes were beginning to slumber</i>;<br />
<i>That moment there rose up before me two maids</i>, <i>whose
charms would take ages to number</i>.</p>
<p><i>One patted my face</i>, <i>and the other
exclaim&rsquo;d</i>, <i>while loading my cheek with her
kisses</i>,<br />
&ldquo;<i>Rise</i>, <i>rise</i>, <i>for to dance with you here we
have sped from the undermost caves and abysses</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Rise</i>, <i>fair-haired swain</i>, <i>and refuse
not to dance</i>;<i> and I and my sister will sing thee</i><br />
<i>The loveliest ditties that ever were heard</i>, <i>and the
prettiest presents will bring thee</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Then both of them sang so delightful a song</i>, <i>that
the boisterous river before us</i><br />
<i>Stood suddenly quiet and placid</i>, <i>as though</i>
&rsquo;<i>twere afraid to disturb the sweet chorus</i>.</p>

mine eyes was slumber descending</i>;<br />

<p><i>The one kissed me on my cheek so white</i>, <i>the other

<p>Targum. / Or / Metrical Translations / From Thirty Languages /
and / Dialects. / By / George Borrow. / &ldquo;<i>The raven has
ascended to the nest of the nightingale</i>.&rdquo; / Persian
Poem. / St. Petersburg. / Printed by Schulz and Beneze. /
1835.</p>
<p>Collation:&mdash;Demy octavo, printed in half-sheets, pp. viii
+ 106; consisting of: Title-page, as above (with <!-- page
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>a
Russian quotation upon the centre of the reverse) pp. i&ndash;ii;
<i>Preface</i> pp. iii&ndash;v; Table of <i>Contents</i> pp.
vi&ndash;viii, with a single <i>Erratum</i> at the foot of p.
viii; and Text of the <i>Translations</i> pp. 1&ndash;106.&nbsp;
There are no head-lines, the pages being numbered centrally in
Arabic numerals.&nbsp; Beyond that upon the foot of the
title-page, there is no imprint.&nbsp; The signatures are given
in large Arabic numerals, each pair of half-sheets dividing one
number between them; thus the first half-sheet is signed 1, the
second 1*, the third 2, the fourth 2*, &amp;c.&nbsp; The Register
is therefore 1 to 7 (thirteen half-sheets, each 4 leaves),
followed by a single unsigned leaf (pp. 105&ndash;106), the whole
preceded by an unsigned half-sheet carrying the Title-page,
Preface, and Table of Contents.&nbsp; The book was issued without
any half-title.</p>
<p>Issued in plain paper wrappers of a bright green colour, lined
with white, and without either lettering or label.&nbsp; The
leaves measure 8 11/16 &times; 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>Borrow was happy in the title he selected for his book.&nbsp;
<i>Targum</i>, as Mr. Gosse has pointed out, is a Chaldee word
meaning an interpretation.&nbsp; The word is said to be the root
of &lsquo;dragoman.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Targum</i> was written by Borrow during his two
years&rsquo; residence at St. Petersburg (August, 1833, to
August, 1835), and was published in June of the latter
year.&nbsp; One hundred copies only were printed.&nbsp; As might
naturally be expected the book has now become of very
considerable rarity, but a small proportion of the original
hundred copies being traceable to-day.</p>
<p>A reduced facsimile of the Title-page is given herewith.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Just before completing this great work, the
<i>Manchu New Testament</i>, Mr. Borrow published a small volume
in the English <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>language, entitled <i>Targum</i>,
<i>or Metrical Translations from Thirty Languages and
Dialects</i>.&nbsp; The exquisite delicacy with which he has
caught and rendered the beauties of his well-chosen originals, is
a proof of his learning and genius.&nbsp; The work is a pearl in
literature, and, like pearls, it derives value from its scarcity,
for the whole edition was limited to about a hundred
copies.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>John P. Hasfeld</i>, <i>in The
Athen&aelig;um</i>, <i>March</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1836.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some days ago I was at Kirtof&rsquo;s bookshop on the
Gaternaya Ulitza.&nbsp; I wanted to buy a <i>Bible in Spain</i>
to send to Simbirsk (on the Volga), where they torment me for it
every post-day.&nbsp; The stock was all sold out in a few days
after its arrival last autumn.&nbsp; The bookseller asked me if I
knew a book by Borrow called <i>Targum</i>, which was understood
to have been written by him and printed at St. Petersburg, but he
had never been able to light upon it; and the surprising thing
was that the trade abroad and even in England did him the honour
to order it.&nbsp; I consoled him by saying that he could hardly
hope to see a copy in his shop or to get a peep at it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have a copy,&rsquo; continued I, &lsquo;but if you will
offer me a thousand roubles for the bare reading of it I cannot
do you the favour.&rsquo;&nbsp; The man opened his eyes in
astonishment.&nbsp; &lsquo;It must be a wonderful book,&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, in that you are right, my good
friend,&rsquo; I replied.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>John P.
Hasfeld</i>.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he became famous the Russian Government was
desirous of procuring a copy of this rare book, <i>Targum</i>,
for the Imperial Library, and sent an Envoy to England for the
purpose.&nbsp; But the Envoy was refused what he sought, and told
that as the book was not worth notice when the author&rsquo;s
name was obscure and they had the opportunity of obtaining it
themselves, they should not have it now.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>A.
Egmont Hake</i>, <i>in The Athen&aelig;um</i>, <i>August</i>
13<i>th</i>, 1881.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The whole of the poems
printed in <i>The Talisman</i> appeared there for the first
time.</p>
<p>In 1892 Messrs. Jarrold &amp; Sons published page for page
reprints of <i>Targum</i> and <i>The Talisman</i>.&nbsp; They
were issued together in one volume, bound in light drab-coloured
paper boards, with white paper back-label, and were accompanied
by the following collective title-page:</p>
<p><i>Targum</i>: / <i>or</i>, / <i>Metrical Translations from
Thirty Languages</i> / <i>and Dialects</i>. / <i>And</i> / <i>The
Talisman</i>, / <i>from the Russian of Alexander Pushkin</i>. /

<i>&amp;c.</i> / <i>London</i>: / <i>Jarrold &amp; Sons</i>, 3,
<i>Paternoster Buildings</i>.</p>
<p>In 1912 a small &lsquo;remainder&rsquo; of <i>The Talisman</i>
came to light.&nbsp; The &lsquo;find&rsquo; consisted of about
Five Copies, which were sold in the first instance for an equal
number of Pence.&nbsp; The buyer appears to have resold them at
progressive prices, commencing at Four Pounds and concluding at
Ten Guineas.</p>

Title-page, as above (with Borrow&rsquo;s Colophon upon the

Gospel pp. 3&ndash;177.&nbsp; The reverse of p. 177 is

The book was issued without any half-title.</p>
<p>I have never seen a copy of the First Edition of
Borrow&rsquo;s translation into the dialect of the Spanish
Gypsies of the Gospel of St. Luke in the original binding.&nbsp;
No doubt the book (which was printed in Madrid) was put up in
paper wrappers, with untrimmed edges, in accordance with the
usual Continental custom.</p>
<p>Most of the copies now extant are either in a modern binding,
or in contemporary brown calf, with marbled edges and
endpapers.&nbsp; The latter are doubtless the copies sent home by
Borrow, and bound in leather for that purpose.&nbsp; The leaves
of these measure 6 &times; 4 inches.</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>As will be seen from the following extracts, it is
probable that the First Edition consisted of 250 copies, and that
50 of these were forwarded to London:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In response to Borrow&rsquo;s letter of
February 27th, the Committee resolved &lsquo;to authorise Mr.
Borrow to print 250 copies of the Gospel of St. Luke, without the
Vocabulary, in the Rummanee dialect, and to engage the services
of a competent person to translate the Gospel of St. Luke by way
of trial in the dialect of the Spanish
Basque.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>Letters of George Borrow to the
British and Foreign Bible Society</i>, 1911, pp.
205&ndash;206.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;A small impression of the Gospel of St. Luke, in the
Rommany, or Gitano, or Gipsy language, has been printed at
Madrid, under the superintendence of this same gentleman, who
himself made the translation for the benefit of the interesting,
singular, degraded race of people whose name it bears, and who
are very numerous in some parts of Spain.&nbsp; He has likewise
taken charge of the printing of the Gospel of St. Luke, in the
Cantabrian, or Spanish Basque language, a translation of which
had fallen into his hands.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>Thirty-Fourth Annual
Report of the British and Foreign Bible Society</i>, 1838, p.
xliii.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the Testaments were stopped at the custom house,
they were contained in two large chests. . . .&nbsp; The chests,
therefore, with the hundred Gospels in Gitano and Basque
[probably 50 copies of each] for the Library of the Bible Society
are at present at San Lucar in the custom house, from which I
expect to receive to-morrow the receipt which the authorities
here demand.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>Borrow&rsquo;s letter to the Rev.
A. Brandram</i>, <i>Seville</i>, <i>May</i> 2<i>nd</i>,
1839.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Second Edition of the Gospel was printed in London in
1871.&nbsp; The collation is Duodecimo, pp. 117.&nbsp; This was
followed by a Third Edition, London, 1872, the collation of which
is also Duodecimo, pp. 117.&nbsp; Both bear the same imprint:
&ldquo;<i>London</i>: / <i>Printed by William Clowes and
Sons</i>, <i>Stamford Street</i>, / <i>and Charing
Cross</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For these London Editions the text was considerably
revised.</p>
<p>The Gospel of St. Luke in the Basque dialect, referred to in
the above paragraphs, is a small octavo volume bearing the
following title-page:</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span><i>Evangelioa</i> / <i>San Lucasen Guissan</i> / <i>El
Evangelio segun S. Lucas</i>. / <i>Traducido al vascuence</i>. /
<i>Madrid</i>: / <i>Imprenta de la Campa&ntilde;ia
Tipografica</i> / 1838.</p>
<p>The translation was the work of a Basque physician named
Oteiza, and Borrow did little more than see it through the
press.&nbsp; The book has, therefore, no claim to rank as a
Borrow <i>princeps</i>.</p>
<p>The measure of success which attended his efforts to reproduce
the Gospel of St. Luke in these two dialects is best told in
Borrow&rsquo;s own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I subsequently published the Gospel of St.
Luke in the Rommany and Biscayan languages.&nbsp; With respect to
the first, I beg leave to observe that no work printed in Spain
ever caused so great and so general a sensation, not so much
amongst the Gypsies, for whom it was intended, as amongst the
Spaniards themselves, who, though they look upon the Roma with
some degree of contempt, nevertheless take a strange interest in
all that concerns them. . . .&nbsp; Respecting the Gospel in
Basque I have less to say.&nbsp; It was originally translated
into the dialect of Guipuscoa by Dr. Oteiza, and subsequently
received corrections and alterations from myself.&nbsp; It can
scarcely be said to have been published, it having been
prohibited and copies of it seized on the second day of its
appearance.&nbsp; But it is in my power to state that it is
anxiously expected in the Basque provinces, where books in the
aboriginal tongue are both scarce and
dear.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>Borrow&rsquo;s Survey of his last two
years in Spain</i>, <i>printed in his Letters to the Bible
Society</i>, 1911, pp. 360&ndash;361.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a copy of the First Edition of <i>The Gospel of St.
Luke in the dialect of the Spanish Gypsies</i> in the Library of

<h3>(9)&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Review of Ford&rsquo;s</span>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hand-book for Travellers in
Spain</span>&rdquo;: 1845]</h3>
<p>Art.&mdash;Hand-book for Travellers in Spain.&nbsp; London: 2
Vols. / post 8vo. 1845.</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>Collation:&mdash;Folio, pp. 12.&nbsp; There is no
Title-page proper, the title, as above, being imposed upon the
upper portion of the first page, after the manner of a
&lsquo;dropped head.&rsquo;&nbsp; The head-line is <i>Spanish
Hand-book</i> throughout, upon both sides of the page.&nbsp;
There is no printer&rsquo;s imprint.&nbsp; There are also no
signatures; but the pamphlet is composed of three sheets, each
two leaves, making twelve pages in all.</p>
<p>Issued stitched, and without wrappers.&nbsp; The leaves
measure 13&frac12; &times; 8&frac12; inches.&nbsp; The pamphlet
is undated.&nbsp; It was printed in 1845.</p>
<p>This <i>Review</i> is unquestionably the rarest of the First
Editions of Borrow&rsquo;s Works.&nbsp; No more than two copies
would appear to have been struck off, and both are fortunately
extant to-day.&nbsp; One of these was formerly in the possession
of Dr. William I. Knapp, and is now the property of the Hispanic
Society, of New York.&nbsp; The second example is in my own
library.&nbsp; This was Borrow&rsquo;s own copy, and is freely
corrected in his characteristic handwriting.&nbsp; A greatly
reduced facsimile of the last page of the pamphlet is given
herewith.</p>
<p>In 1845 Richard Ford published his <i>Hand-Book for Travellers
in Spain and Readers at Home</i> [2 Vols. 8vo.], a work, the
compilation of which is said to have occupied its author for more
than sixteen years.&nbsp; In conformity with the wish of Ford
(who had himself favourably reviewed <i>The Bible in Spain</i>)
Borrow undertook to produce a study of the <i>Hand-Book</i> for
<i>The Quarterly Review</i>.&nbsp; The above Essay was the
result.</p>
<p>But the Essay, brilliant though it is, was not a
&lsquo;Review.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not until page 6 is the
<i>Hand-Book</i> even mentioned, and but little concerning it
appears thereafter.&nbsp; Lockhart, then editing the
<i>Quarterly</i>, proposed to render it more suitable for the
purpose for which it had been intended by himself interpolating a
series <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>of extracts from Ford&rsquo;s
volumes.&nbsp; But Borrow would tolerate no interference with his
work, and promptly withdrew the Essay, which had meanwhile been
set up in type.&nbsp; The following letter, addressed by Lockhart
to Ford, sufficiently explains the position:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>London</i>,<br />
<i>June</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1845.</p>
<p><i>Dear Ford</i>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>El Gitano</i>&rsquo; <i>sent me a paper on the</i>
&ldquo;<i>Hand-Book</i>&rdquo; <i>which I read with
delight</i>.&nbsp; <i>It seemed just another capital chapter of
his</i> &ldquo;<i>Bible in Spain</i>&rdquo; <i>and I thought</i>,
<i>as there was hardly a word of</i> &lsquo;<i>review</i>,&rsquo;
<i>and no extract giving the least notion of the peculiar merits
and style of the</i> &ldquo;<i>Hand-Book</i>,&rdquo; <i>that I
could easily</i> (<i>as is my constant custom</i>) <i>supply the
humbler part myself</i>, <i>and so present at once a fair review
of the work</i>, <i>and a lively specimen of our friend&rsquo;s
vein of eloquence in exordio</i>.</p>
<p><i>But</i>, <i>behold</i>! <i>he will not allow any
tampering</i> . . . .&nbsp; <i>I now write to condole with
you</i>; <i>for I am very sensible</i>, <i>after all</i>, <i>that
you run a great risk in having your book committed to hands far
less competent for treating it or any other book of Spanish
interest than Borrow&rsquo;s would have been</i> . . .<i> and I
consider that</i>, <i>after all</i>, <i>in the case of a new
author</i>, <i>it is the first duty of the</i>
&ldquo;<i>Quarterly Review</i>&rdquo; <i>to introduce that author
fully and fairly to the public</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Ever Yours Truly</i>,<br />
<i>J. G. Lockhart</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our author pictures Gibraltar as a human entity thus
addressing Spain:</p>
<p><i>Accursed land</i>!&nbsp; <i>I hate thee</i>, <i>and far
from being a defence</i>, <i>will invariably prove a thorn in thy
side</i>.</p>
<p>And so on through many sentences of excited rhetoric.&nbsp;
Borrow forgot while he wrote that he had a book to review&mdash;a
book, moreover, issued by the publishing house which issued the
periodical in which his review was to
appear.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>George Borrow and his Circle</i>, 1913,
p. 257].</p>

original edition of his <i>Review of Ford&rsquo;s</i>

<p>This <i>Supplementary Chapter to</i> &ldquo;<i>The Bible in
Spain</i>&rdquo; is a reprint of the Review of Ford&rsquo;s
<i>Hand-book for Travellers in Spain</i> written by Borrow in
1845 for insertion in <i>The Quarterly Review</i>, but withdrawn
by him in consequence of the proposal made by the Editor, John
Gibson Lockhart, that he should himself introduce into
Borrow&rsquo;s Essay a series of extracts from the
<i>Handbook</i>.&nbsp; [See <i>ante</i>, No. 9.]</p>
<p>Included in the <i>Prefatory Note</i> is the following amusing
squib, written by Borrow in 1845, but never printed by him.&nbsp;
I chanced to light upon the Manuscript in a packet of his still
unpublished verse:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Would it not be more dignified</i><br />
<i>To run up debts on every side</i>,<br />
<i>And then to pay your debts refuse</i>,<br />
<i>Than write for rascally Reviews</i>?<br />
<i>And lectures give to great and small</i>,<br />

was prefixed a new <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span

replied to his critics in a somewhat angry and irritable
manner.&nbsp; Copies of the First Edition of <i>Lavengro</i> are
to be met with, the three volumes bound in one, in original
publishers&rsquo; cloth, bearing the name of the firm of Chapman
and Hall upon the back.&nbsp; These copies are
&lsquo;remainders.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were made up in 1870.&nbsp;
It is by no means unlikely that in 1872 some confusion prevailed
as to the nature of this subsidiary issue, and that it was
mistaken for a Second Edition of the book.&nbsp; If so the
incorrect numbering of the edition of that date, the actual
Second Edition, may be readily accounted for.</p>

<p><i>Lavengro</i> / <i>By George Borrow</i> / <i>A New
Edition</i> / <i>Containing the unaltered Text of the Original
Issue</i>; / <i>some Suppressed Passages now printed for the</i>
/ <i>first time</i>; <i>MS. Variorum</i>, <i>Vocabulary and
Notes</i> / <i>By the Author of</i> / <i>The Life of George
Borrow</i> / <i>London</i> / <i>John Murray</i>, <i>Albemarle
Street</i> / 1900.&mdash;Crown 8vo, pp. xxviii + 569.</p>
<p>The book was reprinted in 1911.&nbsp; The Editor was Dr.
William Knapp.</p>
<p>An edition of <i>Lavengro</i>, with a valuable Introduction by
Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton, was published by Messrs. Ward, Lock
&amp; Co., in 1893.&nbsp; The work is also included in
<i>Everyman&rsquo;s Library</i>, and in other series of popular
reprints.</p>
<p>When put to press in February, 1849, the first volume of
<i>Lavengro</i> was set up with the title-page reading as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Life</i>, <i>A Drama</i>. / <i>By</i> / <i>George
Borrow</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, / <i>Author of</i> &ldquo;<i>The Bible
in Spain</i>,&rdquo; <i>etc.</i> / <i>In Three Volumes</i>. /
<i>Vol. i</i>. / <i>London</i>: / <i>John Murray</i>,
<i>Albemarle Street</i>. / 1849.</p>
<p>Only two examples of the volume with this interesting early
title-page are known to have survived.&nbsp; One of these is now
in the possession of the Hispanic Society, of New York.&nbsp; The
other is the property of Mr. Otto Kyllmann.</p>
<p>Later in the same year Murray advertised the work under the
following title:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span><i>Lavengro</i>, <i>An Autobiography</i>.&nbsp; <i>By
George Borrow</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>The same title was employed in the advertisements of 1850.</p>
<p>Mr. Clement Shorter possesses the original draft of the first
portion of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; In this draft the title-page
appears in its earliest form, and describes the book as <i>Some
Account of the Life</i>, <i>Pursuits</i>, <i>and Adventures of a
Norfolk Man</i>.&nbsp; A facsimile of this tentative title was
given by Mr. Shorter in <i>George Borrow and his Circle</i>,
1913, p. 280.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Borrow took many years to write
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am writing the work,&rsquo; he
told Dawson Turner, &lsquo;in precisely the same manner as <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>, viz. on blank sheets of old account-books,
backs of letters,&rsquo; &amp;c., and he recalls Mahomet writing
the Koran on mutton bones as an analogy to his own
&lsquo;slovenliness of manuscript.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have had plenty
of opportunity of testing this slovenliness in the collection of
manuscripts of portions of <i>Lavengro</i> that have come into my
possession.&nbsp; These are written upon pieces of paper of all
shapes and sizes, although at least a third of the book in
Borrow&rsquo;s very neat handwriting is contained in a leather
notebook.&nbsp; The title-page demonstrates the earliest form of
Borrow&rsquo;s conception.&nbsp; Not only did he then contemplate
an undisguised autobiography, but even described himself as
&lsquo;a Norfolk man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Before the book was finished,
however, he repudiated the autobiographical note, and we find him
fiercely denouncing his critics for coming to such a
conclusion.&nbsp; &lsquo;The writer,&rsquo; he declares,
&lsquo;never said it was an autobiography; never authorised any
person to say it was one.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which was doubtless true,
in a measure.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>George Borrow and his Circle</i>,
1913, pp. 279&ndash;281].</p>

<p>Of the First Edition of <i>The Romany Rye</i> One Thousand
Copies were printed.&nbsp; The published price was

in 1872, a Fourth in 1888, and a Fifth in 1896.&nbsp; The book is
included in <i>Everyman&rsquo;s Library</i>, and in other series
of popular reprints.</p>
<p>The series of Advertisements of <i>Works</i> by Borrow,
announced as &ldquo;Ready for the Press,&rdquo; which occupy the
last eight pages of the second volume of <i>The Romany Rye</i>
are of especial interest.&nbsp; No less than twelve distinct
works are included in these advertisements.&nbsp; Of these twelve
<i>The Bible in Spain</i> was already in the hands of the public,
<i>Wild Wales</i> duly appeared in 1862, and <i>The Sleeping
Bard</i> in 1860.&nbsp; These three were all that Borrow lived to
see in print.&nbsp; Two others, <i>The Turkish Jester</i> and
<i>The Death of <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Balder</i>, were published
posthumously in 1884 and 1889 respectively; but the remaining
seven, <i>Celtic Bards</i>, <i>Chiefs</i>, <i>and Kings</i>,
<i>Songs of Europe</i>, <i>K&oelig;mpe Viser</i>, <i>Penquite and
Pentyre</i>, <i>Russian Popular Tales</i>, <i>Northern
Skalds</i>, <i>Kings</i>, <i>and Earls</i>, and <i>Bayr Jairgey
and Glion Doo</i>: <i>The Red Path and the Black Valley</i>, were
never destined to see the light.&nbsp; However, practically the
whole of the verse prepared for them was included in the series
of Pamphlets which have been printed for private circulation
during the past twelve months.</p>
<p>As was the case with <i>Lavengro</i>, Borrow delayed the
completion of <i>The Romany Rye</i> to an extent that much
disconcerted his publisher, John Murray.&nbsp; The correspondence
which passed between author and publisher is given at some length
by Dr. Knapp, in whose pages the whole question is fully
discussed.</p>
<p>Mr. Shorter presents the matter clearly and fairly in the
paragraphs he devotes to the subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The most distinctly English book&mdash;at
least in a certain absence of cosmopolitanism&mdash;that
Victorian literature produced was to a great extent written on
scraps of paper during a prolonged Continental tour which
included Constantinople and Budapest.&nbsp; In <i>Lavengro</i> we
have only half a book, the whole work, which included what came
to be published as <i>The Romany Rye</i>, having been intended to
appear in four volumes.&nbsp; The first volume was written in
1843, the second in 1845, and the third volume in the years
between 1845 and 1848.&nbsp; Then in 1852 Borrow wrote out an
advertisement of a fourth volume, which runs as follows:</p>
<p><i>Shortly will be published in one volume</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Price</i> 10<i>s.</i>&nbsp; <i>The Rommany Rye</i>, <i>Being
the fourth volume of Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; <i>By George Borrow</i>,
<i>author of The Bible in Spain</i>.</p>
<p>But this volume did not make an appearance
&lsquo;shortly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Its author was far too much offended
with the critics, too disheartened it may be, to care to offer
himself again for their gibes.&nbsp; The years rolled on, and not
until 1857 did <i>The Romany Rye</i> appear.&nbsp; The book was
now in two volumes, and we see that the word <i>Romany</i> had
dropped an <i>m</i>. . . .</p>
<p>The incidents of <i>Lavengro</i> are supposed to have taken
place <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>between the 24<i>th</i> of <i>May</i>
1825, and the 18<i>th of July</i> of that year.&nbsp; In <i>The
Romany Rye</i> the incidents apparently occur between the
19<i>th</i> of <i>July</i> and the 3<i>rd</i> of <i>August</i>
1825.&nbsp; In the opinion of Mr. John Sampson, the whole of the
episodes in the five volumes occurred in seventy-two
days.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>George Borrow and his Circle</i>, 1913,
pp. 341&ndash;343.]</p>

no register.&nbsp; The book was issued without any
Half-title.&nbsp; In some copies the Christian name of the
printer is misprinted <i>Jamms</i>.</p>
<p>Issued (in <i>June</i>, 1860) in magenta coloured cloth
boards, lettered in gold along the back, &ldquo;<i>The Sleeping
Bard</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>London</i> / <i>John
Murray</i>&rdquo; across the foot.&nbsp; The published price was
5<i>s.</i>; 250 copies were printed.&nbsp; Murray&rsquo;s
connection with the work was nominal.&nbsp; The book was actually
issued at Yarmouth by J. M. Denew, the printer by whom it was
produced.&nbsp; The cost was borne by the author himself, to whom
the majority of the copies were ultimately delivered.</p>
<p>Some few copies of <i>The Sleeping Bard</i> would appear to
have been put up in yellowish-brown plain paper wrappers, with
untrimmed edges.&nbsp; One such example is in the possession of
Mr. Paul Lemperley, of Cleveland, Ohio; a second is in the
library of Mr. Clement Shorter.&nbsp; The leaves of both these
copies measure 8&frac34; &times; 5&frac34; inches.&nbsp; The
leaves of ordinary copies in cloth measure 7&frac12; &times;
4&frac34; inches.&nbsp; The translation was made in 1830.</p>
<p>The text of <i>The Sleeping Bard</i> is divided into three
sections.&nbsp; Each of these sections closes with a poem of some
length, as follows:&mdash;</p>

Great</i> reads thus:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The song and dance afford</i>, <i>I
ween</i>,<br />
<i>Relief from spleen</i>, <i>and sorrows grave</i>;<br />
<i>How very strange there is no dance</i>,<br />
<i>Nor tune of France</i>, <i>from Death can save</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About the year 1871 Borrow re-wrote this stanza, as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The song and dance can drive</i>, <i>they
say</i>,<br />
<i>The spleen away</i>, <i>and humour&rsquo;s grave</i>;<br />
<i>Why hast thou not devised</i>, <i>O France</i>!<br />
<i>Some tune and dance</i>, <i>from Death to save</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As was invariably the case with Borrow, his revision was a
vast improvement upon the original version.</p>

of <i>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer</i> cast into Romany by
Borrow.&nbsp; The original Manuscript of this translation has
survived, and its text presents some curious variations from the
published version.&nbsp; A reduced facsimile of this Manuscript

Borrow. / Ipswich: / W. Webber, Dial Lane. / 1884.</p>
<p>Collation:&mdash;Crown octavo, printed in half-sheets, pp. ii
+ 52; consisting of: Title-page, as above (with Certificate of
Issue upon the centre of the reverse) pp. i&ndash;ii; and Text
pp. 1&ndash;52.&nbsp; There are no head-lines, the pages being
numbered centrally.&nbsp; The book is made up in a somewhat
unusual manner, each half-sheet having a separately printed
quarter-sheet of two leaves imposed within it.&nbsp; The register
is therefore B to E (four sections, each 6 leaves), plus F (2
leaves), the whole preceded by two leaves, one of which is blank,
whilst the other carries the Title-page.&nbsp; There is no
printer&rsquo;s imprint.&nbsp; The book was issued without any
Half-title.&nbsp; The title is enclosed within a single
rectangular ruled frame.</p>
<p>Issued in cream-coloured paper wrappers, with the title-page
reproduced upon the front, but reset in types of different
character, and without the ruled frame, and with the imprint
reading <i>High Street</i> in place of <i>Dial Lane</i>.&nbsp;
<!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

repeated.&nbsp; The leaves measure 7&frac34; &times; 5
inches.&nbsp; The edition consisted of One Hundred and Fifty
Copies.&nbsp; The published price was 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
<p>The Manuscript of <i>The Turkish Jester</i> was formerly owned
by Dr. Knapp, and is now the property of the Hispanic Society, of
New York.&nbsp; It extends to 71 pages 4to.&nbsp; The translation
was probably made about 1854, at the time when Borrow was at work
upon his <i>Songs of Europe</i>.&nbsp; In 1857, the book was
included among the Advertisements appended to the second volume
of <i>The Romany Rye</i>.</p>

Jester</i> in the Library of the British Museum.&nbsp; The

<h3>(17)&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">The Death of Balder</span>:
1889]</h3>
<p>The / Death of Balder / From the Danish / of / Johannes Ewald
/ (1773) / Translated by / George Borrow / Author of &ldquo;Bible
in Spain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wild
Wales,&rdquo; etc. / London / Jarrold &amp; Sons, 3 Paternoster
Buildings, E.C. / 1889 / All Rights Reserved.</p>
<p>Collation:&mdash;Crown octavo, pp. viii + 77; consisting of:
Half-title (with Certificate of Issue upon the centre of the
reverse) pp. i&ndash;ii; Title-page, as above (with blank
reverse) pp. iii&ndash;iv; <i>Preface</i> and List of <i>The
Persons</i> (each with blank reverse) pp. v&ndash;viii; and Text
pp. 1&ndash;77.&nbsp; The reverse of p. 77 is blank.&nbsp; The
head-line is <i>Death of Balder</i> throughout, upon both sides
of the page.&nbsp; At the foot of p. 77 is the following <!--
page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>imprint, &ldquo;<i>Printed by Ballantyne</i>, <i>Hanson
&amp; Co.</i> / <i>London and Edinburgh</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
signatures are A (4 leaves), and B to F (5 sheets, each 8
leaves).&nbsp; Sig. F 8 is a blank.</p>
<p>Issued in dark brown &lsquo;diced&rsquo; cloth boards, with
white paper back-label.&nbsp; The leaves measure 7&frac34;
&times; 5 inches.&nbsp; Two Hundred and Fifty Copies were
printed.&nbsp; The published price was 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
<p><i>The Death of Balder</i> was written in 1829, the year
during which Borrow produced so many of his ballad translations,
the year in which he made his fruitless effort to obtain
subscribers for his <i>Songs of Scandinavia</i>.&nbsp; On
<i>December</i> 6<i>th</i> of that year he wrote to Dr.
[afterwards Sir] John Bowring:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wish to shew you my translation of <i>The
Death of Balder</i>, Ewald&rsquo;s most celebrated production,
which, if you approve of, you will perhaps render me some
assistance in bringing forth, for I don&rsquo;t know many
publishers.&nbsp; I think this will be a proper time to introduce
it to the British public, as your account of Danish literature
will doubtless cause a sensation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidently no publisher was forthcoming, for the work remained
in manuscript until 1889, when, eight years after Borrow&rsquo;s
death, Messrs. Jarrold &amp; Sons gave it to the world.&nbsp; In
1857 Borrow included the Tragedy among the series of Works
advertised as &ldquo;ready for the Press&rdquo; at the end of the
second volume of <i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; It was there
described as &ldquo;<i>A Heroic Play</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although published only in 1889, <i>The Death of Balder</i>
was actually set up in type three years earlier.&nbsp; It had
been intended that the book should have been issued in London by
Messrs. Reeves &amp; Turner, and proof-sheets exist carrying upon
the title-page the name of that firm as publishers, and bearing
the date 1886.&nbsp; It would appear that Mr. W. Webber, a
bookseller of Ipswich, who then owned the Manuscript, had at
first contemplated issuing the book through Messrs. Reeves &amp;
Turner.&nbsp; But at this <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>juncture he
entered into the employment of Messrs. Jarrold &amp; Sons, and
consequently the books was finally brought out by that
firm.&nbsp; The types were not reset, but were kept standing
during the interval.</p>
<p>Another version of the song of The Three Valkyrier, which
appears in <i>The Death of Balder</i>, pp. 53&ndash;54, was
printed in <i>Marsk Stig&rsquo;s Daughters and Other Songs and
Ballads</i>, 1913, pp. 19&ndash;20.&nbsp; The text of the two
versions differs entirely, in addition to which the 1913 version
forms one complete single song, whilst in that of 1889 the lines
are divided up between the several characters.</p>
<p>The Manuscript of <i>The Death of Balder</i>, referred to
above, passed into the hands of Dr. Knapp, and is now in the
possession of the Hispanic Society, of New York.&nbsp; It
consists of 97 pages 4to.&nbsp; A transcript in the handwriting
of Mrs. Borrow is also the property of the Society.</p>
<p>There is a copy of the First Edition of <i>The Death of
Balder</i> in the Library of the British Museum.&nbsp; The
Press-mark is 11755. f 9.</p>

<p><i>Marsk Stig</i> was one of the ballads prepared by Borrow
for <i>The Songs of Scandinavia</i> in 1829, and revised for the
<i>K&oelig;mpe Viser</i> in 1854.&nbsp; Both Manuscripts are
extant, and I give reproductions of a page of each.&nbsp; It will
be observed that upon the margins of the earlier Manuscript
Borrow wrote his revisions, so that this Manuscript practically
carries in itself both versions of the ballad.&nbsp; The
Manuscript of 1829 is in the possession of Mr. J. H. Spoor, of
Chicago.&nbsp; The Manuscript of 1854 is in my own library.&nbsp;
As a specimen of <i>Marsk Stig</i> I quote the following
stanzas:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>It was the young and bold Marsk Stig</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Came riding into the Castle yard</i>,<br />
<i>Abroad did stand the King of the land</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>So fair array&rsquo;d in sable and mard</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now lend an ear</i>, <i>young Marshal Stig</i>,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I have for thee a fair emprise</i>,<br />
<i>Ride thou this year to the war and bear</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>My flag amongst my enemies</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And if I shall fare to the war this year</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And risk my life among thy foes</i>,<br />
<i>Do thou take care of my Lady dear</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Of Ingeborg</i>, <i>that beauteous
rose</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span><i>Then answer&rsquo;d Erik</i>, <i>the youthful
King</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>With a laugh in his sleeve thus answered
he</i>:<br />
&ldquo;<i>No more I swear has thy lady to fear</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Than if my sister dear were she</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>It was then the bold Sir Marshal Stig</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>From out of the country he did depart</i>,<br />
<i>In her castle sate his lonely mate</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Fair Ingeborg</i>, <i>with grief at
heart</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now saddle my steed</i>,&rdquo; <i>cried Eric the
King</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Now saddle my steed</i>,&rdquo; <i>King
Eric cried</i>,<br />

<i>Live thou with me in love and glee</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Whilst Marshal Stig is engag&rsquo;d in
war</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Then up and spake Dame Ingeborg</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For nought was she but a virtuous wife</i>:<br />
&ldquo;<i>Rather</i>, <i>I say</i>, <i>than Stig betray</i>,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Sir King</i>, <i>I&rsquo;d gladly lose my

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>If thou my leman and love will be</i>,<br />
<i>Each finger fair of thy hand shall bear</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A ring of gold so red of blee</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Marsk Stig has given gold rings to me</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And pearls around my neck to string</i>;<br />
<i>By the Saints above I never will prove</i><br />

furnishes a reason for the catastrophe which was lacking in the
earlier version.</p>
<p>In its final shape <i>The Treacherous Merman</i> is another of
Borrow&rsquo;s most successful ballads, and it is evident that he
bestowed upon it an infinite amount of care and labour.&nbsp; An

tentative title <i>Marsk Stig&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&nbsp; Besides

<p>Of <i>The Mermaid&rsquo;s Prophecy</i> there are two
Manuscripts extant.&nbsp; In the earlier of these, written in
1829, the Poem is entitled <i>The Mermaid&rsquo;s
Prophecy</i>.&nbsp; In the later Manuscript, written apparently
<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>about the year 1854, it is entitled <i>The Mermaid</i>
only.&nbsp; From this later Manuscript the Poem was printed in
the present volume.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of Borrow&rsquo;s Manuscripts, which
usually exhibit extreme differences of text when two holographs
exist of the same Poem, the texts of the two versions of <i>The
Mermaid&rsquo;s Prophecy</i> are practically identical, the
opening stanza alone presenting any important variation.&nbsp;
Here are the two versions of this stanza:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1829</p>
<p>The Dane King had the Mermaiden caught by his swains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The mermaid dances the floor upon</i>&mdash;<br
/>
And her in the tower had loaded with chains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because his will she had not done.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1854</p>
<p>The King he has caught the fair mermaid, and deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>The mermaid dances the floor upon</i>)<br />
In the dungeon has placed her, to pine and to weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because his will she had not done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of <i>Hafbur and Signe</i> two Manuscripts are extant.&nbsp;
The first of these was doubtless written in the early summer of
1830, for on <i>June</i> 1<i>st</i> of that year Borrow wrote to
Dr. Bowring:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I send you</i> &ldquo;<i>Hafbur and
Signe</i>&rdquo; <i>to deposit in the Scandinavian Treasury</i>
[i.e. among the <i>Songs of Scandinavia</i>].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The later Manuscript was written in or about the year
1854.</p>
<p>The earlier of these two Manuscripts is in the collection of
Mr. Herbert T. Butler.&nbsp; The later Manuscript is in my own
library.</p>
<p>As is usually the case when two Manuscripts of one of
Borrow&rsquo;s ballads are available, the difference in poetical
value of the two versions of <i>Hafbur and Signe</i> is
considerably.&nbsp; Few examples could exhibit more distinctly
the advance made by Borrow in the art of poetical composition
during the interval.&nbsp; Here are some stanzas from the version
of 1854.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span><i>So late it was at nightly
tide</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Down fell the dew o&rsquo;er hill and
mead</i>;<br />
<i>Then lists it her proud Signild fair</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>With all the rest to bed to speed</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>O where shall I a bed procure</i>?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Said Hafbur then</i>, <i>the King&rsquo;s good
son</i>.<br />
&ldquo;<i>O thou shalt rest in chamber best</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>With me the bolsters blue upon</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Proud Signild foremost went</i>, <i>and stepped</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The threshold of her chamber o&rsquo;er</i>;<br
/>
<i>With secret glee came Hafbur</i>, <i>he</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Had never been so glad before</i>.</p>
<p><i>Then lighted they the waxen lights</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>So fairly twisted were the same</i>.<br />
<i>Behind</i>, <i>behind</i>, <i>with ill at mind</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The wicked servant maiden came</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following are the parallel stanzas from the version of
1830</p>
<blockquote><p><i>So late it was in the nightly tide</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dew fell o&rsquo;er hill and mead</i>;<br />
<i>Then listed her proud Signild fair</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>With the rest to bed to speed</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>O where shall I a bed procure</i>?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Said Hafbour the King&rsquo;s good son</i>.<br />
&ldquo;<i>In the chamber best with me thou shalt rest</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The bolsters blue upon</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Proud Signild foremost went and stepp&rsquo;d</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The high chamber&rsquo;s threshold
o&rsquo;er</i>,<br />
<i>Prince Hafbour came after with secret laughter</i>,<br />

the following imprint: &ldquo;<i>London</i>: / <i>Printed for
Thomas J. Wise</i>, <i>Hampstead</i>, <i>N. W.</i> / <i>Edition

one inset within the other.&nbsp; <!-- page 154--><a

Frontispiece consists of a reduced facsimile of the first page of
the original Manuscript in Borrow&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>
<p>Issued in bright green paper wrappers, with untrimmed edges,
and with the title-page reproduced upon the front.&nbsp; The
leaves measure 8&frac12; &times; 6&#8542; inches.</p>
<p>Thirty Copies only were printed.</p>
<p><i>The Story of Yvashka</i> was the second of three <i>Russian
Popular Tales</i>, which were contributed by Borrow to the pages
of <i>Once a Week</i> during 1862.&nbsp; <i>The Story of
Yvashka</i> appeared in the number for <i>May</i> 17<i>th</i>,
1862, Vol. vi, pp. 572&ndash;574.</p>
<p>The <i>Story</i> was reprinted in <i>The Sphere</i>,
<i>Feb.</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1913, p. 136.</p>
<p>The Text of <i>Yvashka</i> as printed in <i>Once a Week</i>
differs appreciably from that printed in <i>The Sphere</i>, and
in the private pamphlet of 1913, both of which are
identical.&nbsp; The Manuscript from which the two latter
versions were taken was the original translation.&nbsp; The
version which appeared in <i>Once a Week</i> was printed from a
fresh Manuscript (which fills 11 quarto pages) prepared in
1862.&nbsp; A reduced facsimile of the first page of the earlier
Manuscript (which extends to 5&#8539; quarto pages) will be found
reproduced upon the opposite page.&nbsp; In this Manuscript the
story is entitled <i>The History of Jack with the Bear&rsquo;s
Ear</i>.</p>
<p>Judging from the appearance of this MS., both paper and
handwriting, together with that of fragments which remain of the
original MSS. of the other two published <i>Tales</i>, it seems
probable that the whole were produced by Borrow during his
residence in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; Should such surmise be
correct, the <i>Tales</i> are contemporary with
<i>Targum</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Once a Week</i> version of <i>The Story of Yvashka</i>
was reprinted in <i>The Avon Booklet</i>, Vol. ii, 1904, pp.
199&ndash;210.</p>

<p>As a further example of Borrow&rsquo;s shorter Ballads, I give
<i>Ingeborg&rsquo;s Disguise</i> in full.&nbsp; The entire series
included in <i>The Return of the Dead and Other Ballads</i> ranks
among the most uniformly successful of Borrow&rsquo;s
achievements in this particular branch of literature:&mdash;</p>

<p>In some respects <i>Axel Thordson and Fair Valborg</i> is the
most ambitious of Borrow&rsquo;s Ballads.&nbsp; It is
considerably the longest, unless we regard the four
&ldquo;<i>Songs</i>&rdquo; of which <i>Marsk Stig</i> is
comprised as forming one complete poem.&nbsp; But it is by no
means the most successful; indeed it is invariably in his shorter
Ballads that we find Borrow obtaining the happiest result.</p>
<p>Two Manuscripts of <i>Axel Thordson and Fair Valborg</i> are
available.&nbsp; The first was prepared in 1829 for the <i>Songs
of Scandinavia</i>.&nbsp; The second was revised in 1854 for the
<i>K&oelig;mpe Viser</i>.&nbsp; This later Manuscript is in my
own possession.&nbsp; I give herewith a reduced facsimile of one

<p>I venture to regard this ballad of the fight between Bran and
the Black Dog as one of Borrow&rsquo;s happiest efforts.&nbsp;
Here are some of its vigorous stanzas:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The valiant Finn arose next day</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Just as the sun rose above the foam</i>;<br />
<i>And he beheld up the Lairgo way</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A man clad in red with a black dog come</i>.</p>
<p><i>He came up with a lofty gait</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Said not for shelter he sought our doors</i>;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And he struck with his fist his good dog
Bran</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Take off from his neck the collar of gold</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Not right for him now such a thing to
bear</i>;<br />
<i>And a free good fight we shall behold</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Betwixt my dog and his black
compeer</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The dogs their noses together placed</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Then their blood was scatter&rsquo;d on every
side</i>;<br />
<i>Desperate the fight</i>, <i>and the fight did last</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;<i>Till the brave black dog in Bran&rsquo;s

first page of the MS.:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">TRANSLATION.</p>
<p>One summer morn, as I was seeking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My ponies in their green retreat,<br />
I heard a lady sing a ditty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To me which sounded strangely sweet:</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span><i>I am the ladye</i>, <i>I am the ladye</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I am the ladye loving the knight</i>;<br />
<i>I in the green wood</i>, &rsquo;<i>neath the green
branches</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In the night season sleep with the
knight</i>.</p>
<p>Since yonder summer morn of beauty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen full many a gloomy year;<br />
But in my mind still lives the ditty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That in the green wood met my ear:</p>
<p><i>I am the ladye</i>, <i>I am the ladye</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I am the ladye loving the knight</i>;<br />
<i>I in the green wood</i>, &rsquo;<i>neath the green
branches</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In the night season sleep with the
knight</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second Manuscript of this <i>Translation</i> has the
&lsquo;ditty&rsquo; arranged in eight lines, instead of in
four.&nbsp; In this MS. the word <i>ladye</i> is spelled in the
conventional manner:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I am the lady</i>,<br />
<i>I am the lady</i>,<br />
<i>I am the lady</i><br />

<p>Fifteen stanzas, descriptive of the incident of Orm&rsquo;s
obtaining his father&rsquo;s sword from the dead man&rsquo;s
grave, were printed in <i>Targum</i>, 1835, pp. 59&ndash;61,
under the title <i>Birting</i>.&nbsp; <i>A Fragment</i>.&nbsp;
The text differs greatly in the two versions, that of the later
(which, <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>though not printed until 1913, was
written about 1854) is much the superior.&nbsp; As an example I
give the first two stanzas of each version:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1835</p>
<p><i>It was late at evening tide</i>,<br />
<i>Sinks the day-star in the wave</i>,<br />
<i>When alone Orm Ungarswayne</i><br />
<i>Rode to seek his father&rsquo;s grave</i>.</p>
<p><i>Late it was at evening hour</i>,<br />
<i>When the steeds to streams are led</i>;<br />
<i>Let me now</i>, <i>said Orm the young</i>,<br />
<i>Wake my father from the dead</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1913</p>
<p><i>It was so late at evening tide</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The sun had reached the wave</i>,<br />
<i>When Orm the youthful swain set out</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To seek his father&rsquo;s grave</i>.</p>
<p><i>It was the hour when grooms do ride</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The coursers to the rill</i>,<br />
<i>That Orm set out resolved to wake</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The dead man in the hill</i>.</p>

<p>The Manuscript of these <i>Epigrams</i> bears instructive
evidence of the immense amount of care and labour expended by
Borrow upon his metrical compositions.&nbsp; Reduced facsimiles
of two of the pages of this Manuscript are given herewith.&nbsp;
It will be observed that a full page and a half are occupied by
the thirteenth <i>Epigram</i>, at which Borrow made no fewer than
seven attempts before he succeeded in producing a version which
satisfied him.&nbsp; The completed <i>Epigram</i> is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>So much like a friend with your foe ever
deal</i>,<br />
<i>That you never need dread the least scratch from his
steel</i>;<br />
<i>But ne&rsquo;er with your friend deal so much like a
foe</i>,<br />
<i>That you ever must dread from his faulchion a blow</i>.</p>

<p>There are two Manuscripts of <i>The Elves</i> available.&nbsp;
So far as the body of the poem is concerned the texts of these
are identical, the fifth line alone differing materially in
each.&nbsp; This line, as printed, reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The lass he woo&rsquo; d</i>, <i>her promise
won</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the earlier of the two MSS. it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Inflamed with passion her he
woo&rsquo;d</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A cancelled reading of the same MS. runs:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Whom when he saw the peasant
woo&rsquo;d</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Ballad is furnished with a repeated refrain.&nbsp;
This refrain in the printed version reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Take heed</i>, <i>good people</i>, <i>of
yourselves</i>;<br />
<i>And oh</i>! <i>beware ye of the elves</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the earlier MS. the refrain employed is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;<i>Tis wonderful the Lord can brook</i><br
/>
<i>The insolence of the fairy folk</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A reduced facsimile of the first page of the later MS. will be

<p>Of <i>The Fountain of Maribo</i> there are two Manuscripts
available, one written in 1829 and the other in 1854.&nbsp; The
text of these differs appreciably, that of the second being as
usual the superior.&nbsp; Here are some stanzas from each
version:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1829</p>

&ldquo;Go, come to me hither the Algreve request.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Love me doth thrall</i>.</p>

&ldquo;What wilt thou my Queen that thou&rsquo;st sent for

<p>The Introduction furnished by Mr. Edmund Gosse to
<i>Grimhild&rsquo;s Vengeance</i> is undoubtedly by far the most
illuminating and important contribution yet made to the critical
study of Borrow&rsquo;s Ballads, a study which has hitherto been
both meagre and inadequate.&nbsp; Not only does Mr. Gosse handle
the three <i>Songs</i> particularly before him, and make clear
the relationship they bear to each other, but he deals with the
whole subject of the <!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>origin of Borrow&rsquo;s
Scandinavian Ballads, and traces fully and precisely the
immediate source from which their author derived them.&nbsp; One
of Borrow&rsquo;s most vivid records Mr. Gosse calls into
question, and proves indisputably that it must henceforth be
regarded, if not as a fiction, at least as one more result of
Borrow&rsquo;s inveterate habit of &ldquo;drawing the long
bow,&rdquo;&mdash;to wit the passages in <i>Lavengro</i> wherein
Borrow recounts his acquisition of the &ldquo;strange and
uncouth-looking volume&rdquo; at the price of a kiss from the
yeoman&rsquo;s wife, and the purpose which that volume served
him.</p>
<p>Of the first and second of the three Ballads included in
<i>Grimhild&rsquo;s Vengeance</i> two Manuscripts are
available.&nbsp; The first of these was written in 1829, and was
intended to find a place in the <i>Songs of Scandinavia</i>
advertised at the close of that year.&nbsp; The second Manuscript
was written in 1854, and was prepared for the projected volumes
of <i>K&oelig;mpe Viser</i> of that date.&nbsp; Of the third
Ballad there exists only a single Manuscript, namely that
produced in 1829.&nbsp; Apparently in 1854 Borrow had
relinquished all hope of publishing the <i>K&oelig;mpe Viser</i>
before he had commenced work upon the third Ballad.&nbsp; In the
present volume the first two <i>Songs</i> were printed from the
Manuscripts of 1854; the third <i>Song</i> from the Manuscript of
1829.</p>
<p>There is a copy of <i>Grimhild&rsquo;s Vengeance</i> in the
Library of the British Museum.&nbsp; The Press-mark is C. 44. d.

<h3>(59)&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">The Gold Horns</span>:
1913]</h3>
<p>The Gold Horns / Translated by / George Borrow / from the
Danish of / Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl&auml;ger / Edited / with an
Introduction by / Edmund Gosse, C.B. / London: / Printed for
Private Circulation / 1913.</p>
<p>Collation:&mdash;Square demy octavo, pp. 25; consisting of:
Half-title (with blank reverse) pp. 1&ndash;2; Title-page, as
above (with a note regarding the American copyright upon the
centre of the reverse) pp. 3&ndash;4; <i>Introduction</i> pp.
5&ndash;9; and Text of <i>The Gold Horns</i>, the Danish and
English texts facing each other upon opposite pages, pp.
10&ndash;25.&nbsp; The reverse of p. 25 is blank.&nbsp; There are
head-lines throughout, <!-- page 272--><a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>each recto
being headed <i>The Gold Horns</i>, and each verso
<i>Guldhornene</i>.&nbsp; The book is completed by a leaf, with
blank reverse, and with the following imprint upon its recto:
&ldquo;<i>London</i>: / <i>Printed for Thomas J. Wise</i>,
<i>Hampstead</i>, <i>N.W.</i> / <i>Edition limited to Thirty
Copies</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The signatures are A (a half-sheet of
four leaves), B (a quarter-sheet of two leaves), and C (a full
sheet of eight leaves), each inset within the other.</p>
<p>Issued in bright green paper wrappers, with untrimmed edges,
and with the title-page reproduced upon the front.&nbsp; The
leaves measure 8&frac12; &times; 6&#8542; inches.</p>
<p>Thirty Copies only were printed.</p>
<p>Although the poem was not printed until 1913, it is quite
evident that the translation was made by Borrow in or about the
year 1826.&nbsp; The paper upon which the Manuscript is written
is watermarked with the date 1824, whilst the handwriting
coincides with that of several of the pieces included in the
<i>Romantic Ballads of</i> 1826.&nbsp; &ldquo;There can be little
doubt,&rdquo; writes Mr. Gosse, &ldquo;that Borrow intended
<i>The Gold Horns</i> for that volume, and rejected it at
last.&nbsp; He was conscious, perhaps, that his hand had lacked
the skill needful to reproduce a lyric the melody of which would
have taxed the powers of Coleridge or of Shelley.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>The Gold Horns</i> marks one of the most
important stages in the history of Scandinavian literature.&nbsp;
It is the earliest, and the freshest, specimen of the Romantic
Revival in its definite form.&nbsp; In this way, it takes in
Danish poetry a place analogous to that taken by <i>The Ancient
Mariner</i> in English poetry. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oehlenschl&auml;ger has explained what it was that
suggested to him the leading idea of his poem.&nbsp; Two antique
horns of gold, discovered some time before in the bogs of
Slesvig, had been recently stolen from the national collection at
Rosenberg, and the thieves had melted <!-- page 273--><a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>down the
inestimable treasures.&nbsp; Oehlenschl&auml;ger treats these
horns as the reward for genuine antiquarian enthusiasm, shown in
a sincere and tender passion for the ancient relics of
Scandinavian history.&nbsp; From a generation unworthy to
appreciate them, the <i>Horns</i> had been withdrawn, to be
mysteriously restored at the due romantic
hour.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>From the Introduction by Edmund
Gosse</i>.]</p>

and was intended to find a place in <i>The Songs of
Scandinavia</i>.&nbsp; The third was prepared in 1854, with a
view to its appearance in the <i>K&oelig;mpe Viser</i>.&nbsp; In
the two earlier versions the Ballad bears the tentative title
<i>The Expedition of King Diderik&rsquo;s Warriors to

[<i>Who will ever have again</i>]</p>
<p>Previously printed in <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, Vol. lvi,

<p>There exists an early Manuscript of this charming lyric,
differing entirely from the text as printed.&nbsp; This early
version is written in couplets, instead of in four-line
stanzas.&nbsp; Here is the first stanza, followed by the
equivalent couplet from the MS.:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Printed text.</p>
<p><i>Who will ever have again</i>,<br />
<i>On the land or on the main</i>,<br />
<i>Such a chance as happen&rsquo;d to</i><br />

<p>Upon the opposite page I give a facsimile of this early
Manuscript, the exact size of the original.&nbsp; The tiny waif
affords a delightful specimen of Borrow&rsquo;s extremely
beautiful and graceful minute handwriting, of which one or two
other examples exist.&nbsp; The paper upon which the lines are
written is evidently a leaf torn from a small note-book.</p>

ancient Danish Literature, by Olaus Wormius, carrying several
marginal notes in Borrow&rsquo;s handwriting.&nbsp; The

Borrow very considerably revised the text.&nbsp; Here is the
concluding stanza of each of the two versions:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1823</p>
<blockquote><p><i>But God shook his sceptre</i>, <i>and
thunder&rsquo;d appalling</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>While winds swept the branches with turbulent

&ldquo;<i>Ah</i>, <i>we had a sister on earthly

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>All sung</i>, <i>as thro&rsquo; heaven they

<p>Upon each occasion he practically rewrote the <i>Song</i>, so
that all four versions differ completely.&nbsp; As an

version:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1823.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In smoke and flame</i>;<br />

<p><!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

in the two versions, I give three stanzas of each:</p>

/>
<i>Took the coffin on his back</i>;<br />
<i>And to fair Eliza&rsquo;s bower</i><br />
<i>Hasten&rsquo;d</i>, <i>by the well-known track</i>.</p>
<p><i>On her chamber&rsquo;s lowly portal</i>,<br />
<i>With his fingers long and thin</i>,<br />

<p><i>Straightway answer&rsquo;d fair Eliza</i>,<br />

<p><span class="smcap">The Welsh and Their
Literature</span>.&nbsp; A Prose Essay.</p>
<p>This Essay was in fact a review, by Borrow himself, of his own
work <i>The Sleeping Bard</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the autumn [of 1860] Borrow determined
to call attention to it [<i>The Sleeping Bard</i>] himself.&nbsp;
He revamped an old article he had written in 1830, entitled
<i>The Welsh and their Literature</i>, and sent it to Mr. Murray
for <i>The Quarterly Review</i>. . . .&nbsp; The modern
literature and things of Wales were not introduced into the
article . . . and it appeared anonymously in <i>The Quarterly
Review</i> for January, 1861.&nbsp; It is in fact Borrow&rsquo;s
own (and the only) review of <i>The Sleeping Bard</i>, which,
however, had the decisive result of selling off the whole edition
in a month.&rdquo;&mdash;[Knapp&rsquo;s <i>Life and
Correspondence of George Borrow</i>, 1899, vol. ii, pp.
195&ndash;196.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Manuscript of this Essay, or Review, is not at present
forthcoming.&nbsp; But, fortunately, the MS. of certain
paragraphs with which Borrow brought the Essay to a conclusion,
and which the Editor in the exercise of his editorial function
quite properly struck out, have been preserved.&nbsp; The
barefaced manner in which Borrow anonymously praised and
advertised his own work fully justified the Editor&rsquo;s
action.&nbsp; I print these paragraphs below.&nbsp; My principal
reason for doing so is this, that the closing lines <!-- page
298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>afford evidence of Borrow&rsquo;s authorship of other
portions of Gill&rsquo;s Introduction to his Edition of
<i>Kelly&rsquo;s Manx Grammar</i>, 1859, beyond those which until
now have been attributed to his pen:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our having mentioned <i>The Romany Rye</i>
gives us an opportunity of saying a few words concerning that
work, to the merits of which, and likewise to those of
<i>Lavengro</i>, of which it is the sequel, adequate justice has
never been awarded.&nbsp; It is a truly remarkable book,
abounding not only with strange and amusing adventure, but with
deep learning communicated in a highly agreeable form.&nbsp; We
owe it an <i>amende honorable</i> for not having in our recent
essay on Buddhism quoted from it some remarkable passages on that
superstition, which are to be found in a conversation between the
hero of the tale and the man in black.&nbsp; Never was the
subject of Buddhism treated in a manner so masterly and
original.&nbsp; But the book exhibits what is infinitely more
precious than the deepest learning, more desirable than the most
amusing treasury of adventure, a fearless, honest spirit, a
resolution to tell the truth however strange the truth may appear
to the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A remarkable proof of this is to be found in what is
said in it respecting the Italians.&nbsp; It is all very well at
the present day, after the miracles lately performed in Italy by
her sons, to say that Italy is the land to which we must look for
great men; that it is not merely the country of singers,
fiddlers, <i>improvisatori</i>, and linguists, but of men, of
beings who may emphatically be called men.&nbsp; But who, three
or four years ago, would have ventured to say as much?&nbsp; Why
there was one and only one who ventured to say so, and that was
George Borrow in his work entitled <i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp;
Many other things equally bold and true he has said in that work,
and also in its predecessor <i>Lavengro</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In conclusion we wish to give Mr. Borrow a piece of
advice, namely, that with all convenient speed he publish
whatever works he has written and has not yet committed to the
press.&nbsp; Life is very precarious, and when an author dies,
his unpublished writings are too frequently either lost to the
world, or presented in a shape which all but stultifies
them.&nbsp; Of Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s unpublished writings there is a
catalogue at the end of <i>The Romany Rye</i>, and a most
remarkable catalogue it is, comprising works on all kinds of
interesting subjects.&nbsp; <!-- page 299--><a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>Of these,
the one which we are most eager to see is that which is called
<i>Wild Wales</i>, which we have no doubt whenever it appears
will be welcomed as heartily as <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was
seventeen years ago, a book which first laid open the mysterious
peninsula to the eyes of the world, and that the book on Wales
will be followed by the one which is called <i>Wanderings in
quest of Manx Literature</i>.&nbsp; Now the title alone of that
book is worth a library of commonplace works, for it gives the
world an inkling of a thing it never before dreamed of, namely,
that the little Celtic Isle of Man has a vernacular
literature.&nbsp; What a pity if the book itself should be
eventually lost!&nbsp; Here some person will doubtless exclaim,
&lsquo;Perhaps the title is all book, and there is no book behind
it; what can Mr. Borrow know of Manx literature?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Stay, friend, stay!&nbsp; A Manx grammar has just appeared,
edited by a learned and highly respectable Manx clergyman, in the
preface to which are some beautiful and highly curious notices of
Manx vernacular Gallic literature, which are, however,
confessedly not written by the learned Manx clergyman, nor by any
other learned Manxman, but by George Borrow, an Englishman, the
author of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> and <i>The Romany
Rye</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A number of translations from Welsh Poetry were introduced by
Borrow into this Essay.&nbsp; They were all, as he explained in a
footnote, derived from his projected <i>Songs of
Europe</i>.&nbsp; With the exception of an occasional stray
couplet, or single line, the following list includes them
all:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">From Iolo Goch&rsquo;s</span>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Ode to the Plough
Man</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; [<i>The mighty Hu with mead would
pay</i>]</p>
<p>Reprinted, with several changes in the text, in <i>Wild
Wales</i>, 1862, Vol. iii, pp. 292&ndash;293.</p>
<p>A further extract from the same <i>Ode</i>, &ldquo;<i>If with
small things we Hu compare</i>&rdquo; etc., is given in a
footnote on p. 40.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Saxons and Britons</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>A serpent that coils</i>]</p>
<p>Reprinted (the first line reading <i>A serpent which

variations are connected with Borrow&rsquo;s attitude towards the
British and Foreign Bible Society, Mr. Shorter having taken
occasion to pass some severe strictures upon the obvious cant
which characterised the Bible Society in its relations with
Borrow.&nbsp; These strictures, although supported by ample
quotations from unpublished documents, the London publishers,
being a semi-religious house, persuaded the author to cancel.</p>

<h2>Notes on the Project Gutenberg Transcription</h2>
<p>In the original book the facsimiles occupy a full page and do
not carry a page number.&nbsp; In each the verso of the page is
blank.&nbsp; In both cases the page counts towards the page
number, which is why there are gaps in the page numbering.</p>
<p>The inset nature of the facsimiles also means that in the book
they break the flow of the text and are sometimes not even in the
section to which they belong.&nbsp; In the transcription they
have usually been moved to the end of the section to which they
belong.&nbsp; Their original page position is given by their
filename (e.g. p304.jpg was originally on page 304).</p>
<p>On page 48 in the paragraph starting &ldquo;<i>Targum</i> was
written by Borrow&rdquo;, the &ldquo;but a small
proportion&rdquo; is as in the book, but should probably be
&ldquo;but only&rdquo;, or &ldquo;with&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On page 87 the book has &ldquo;One of these is now, in the
possession . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>On page 136 the book has no full-stop at the end of
&ldquo;<i>To the ears of the Queen in her bed it
rang</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On page 144 &ldquo;Edition limited to Thirty Copies&rdquo; has
no closing quote.</p>
<p>On page 231 &ldquo;Edition limited to Thirty Copies&rdquo; has
no closing quote.</p>
<p>On page 253 the full-stop is missing after &ldquo;reproduced
upon the front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On page 287 for &ldquo;Freshly blew&rdquo; the book has
&ldquo;Freshl blew&rdquo;.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
